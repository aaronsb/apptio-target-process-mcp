## Summary

Implements secure attachment analysis operation that enables AI vision frameworks to safely process TargetProcess attachments. This addresses the need identified in PR #21 while incorporating all security enhancements requested in the June 19th feedback.

## Key Features

### 🔒 Security-First Approach
- **MIME type whitelist**: Only safe image and document types allowed
- **File size limits**: 50MB maximum with informative error messages  
- **Filename validation**: Blocks suspicious patterns and double extensions
- **Safe processing**: Secure base64 encoding without complex libraries

### 🤖 AI Framework Ready
- **Model-agnostic output**: Works with Claude, GPT-4V, Gemini, etc.
- **Clean base64 data**: Ready for direct AI consumption
- **No image resampling**: Delegates processing to AI frameworks
- **Rich metadata**: Includes file type, size, and security status

### 🛠️ Semantic Operation Features
- **Available to all roles**: Default, developer, tester, PM, product owner
- **Rich formatting**: Emoji-based UI consistent with other operations
- **Performance tracking**: Execution time monitoring
- **Intelligent suggestions**: Context-aware next actions

## Technical Implementation

### New API Methods
- `getAttachmentInfo(attachmentId)` - Fetch attachment metadata
- `downloadAttachment(attachmentId)` - Secure content download

### Security Validation Pipeline
1. **File type check** - MIME type whitelist validation
2. **Size validation** - 50MB limit with user-friendly errors
3. **Filename security** - Suspicious pattern detection
4. **Safe download** - Secure base64 encoding

### Operation Structure
```typescript
// Usage examples:
analyze-attachment attachmentId:12345
analyze-attachment attachmentId:67890 includeMetadata:false
```

## Example Output

```
