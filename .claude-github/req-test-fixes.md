# Test Suite Stability and Quality

**As a** developer maintaining the Target Process MCP server  
**I want** all tests to pass reliably with proper TypeScript configuration  
**So that** CI/CD pipelines work correctly and code quality is maintained

## Background

The current test suite has several issues preventing reliable execution:
1. TypeScript configuration warnings about `isolatedModules`
2. Type errors in test files using `any` types
3. Empty mock test file causing Jest failures
4. Type safety violations in API service tests

## Acceptance Criteria

### Configuration Quality
- When TypeScript compiles test files, then no warnings should appear about module configuration
- When Jest runs, then no empty test suites should cause failures

### Type Safety
- When test scenarios use callback functions, then they should have proper TypeScript types
- When API service tests mock responses, then mock types should be properly typed
- When tests reference external types, then all imports should be correctly resolved

### Test Reliability  
- When `npm test` runs, then all test suites should pass without errors
- When tests execute, then no console errors should appear from type violations
- When CI runs tests, then the build should succeed consistently

## Impact
- Improved developer experience with reliable test execution
- Better code quality through proper TypeScript configuration
- Stable CI/CD pipeline execution
- Foundation for future test development

## Files Affected
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `src/__tests__/agent-usability/scenarios.ts` - Agent test scenarios
- `src/__tests__/mocks/tp-service.mock.ts` - Mock service file  
- `src/__tests__/api/tp.service.test.ts` - API service tests
