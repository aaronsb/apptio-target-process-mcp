# Targetprocess MCP Server

## What is this?

The Targetprocess MCP Server enables AI assistants to interact with your Targetprocess data, letting you query, create, and manage work items through natural language. Ask questions about your projects, update work items, and get insights without switching contexts.

## Why use it?

- **Talk to Your Data**: Ask questions about user stories, bugs, and projects in natural language
- **Stay in Flow**: Update work items without switching to the Targetprocess UI
- **Discover Relationships**: Understand how projects, features, and stories connect
- **Automate Reporting**: Generate custom reports and dashboards through conversation
- **Enterprise Ready**: Handles complex schemas and millions of records with robust authentication and error handling

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run with Docker
docker run -i --rm \
  -e TP_DOMAIN=your-domain.tpondemand.com \
  -e TP_USERNAME=your-username \
  -e TP_PASSWORD=your-password \
  ghcr.io/aaronsb/apptio-target-process-mcp
```
