## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use Basic First**: Start with `analysisType: "basic"` to get metadata quickly
2. **Detailed for Images**: Use `analysisType: "detailed"` only for images you want to analyze visually
3. **Large Files**: Be aware that detailed analysis of large images may take longer
4. **AI Analysis**: After detailed analysis, you can ask Claude specific questions about the displayed image
5. **Context Correlation**: Use the entity information to understand how the attachment relates to the bug/story
