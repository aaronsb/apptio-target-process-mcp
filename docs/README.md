‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY READING BEFORE CONTRIBUTING** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is NOT just another API wrapper! We implement **SEMANTIC OPERATIONS** - intelligent, context-aware workflows. Before writing ANY code:

1. **READ [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Required for ALL contributors
2. **UNDERSTAND [Semantic Operations](semantic-operations/)** - This is the HEART of the project
3. **ACCEPT the philosophy** - We build tools that think, not just call APIs

**If you skip this, your PR will be rejected.**

</div>

1. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Contribution guidelines (READ FIRST!)
2. **[Semantic Operations Overview](semantic-operations/)** - Core philosophy (MUST READ)
3. **[Development Guide](development/README.md)** - Setup and patterns
4. **[Tool Documentation](tools/)** - Individual tool details

### üèóÔ∏è For Architects (I want to understand the system)

**Start Here:** If you want to understand the system design, architecture, or business value.
