# Enterprise Use Cases

This document outlines complex enterprise use cases for using the Targetprocess MCP in corporate environments where you might be dealing with millions of records, complex schemas, and custom data models.

## Data Model Discovery and Mapping

**Business Value:**
- Gain visibility into complex, customized Targetprocess instances
- Document entity relationships for system integration
- Identify optimization opportunities in process workflows
- Support migration or consolidation projects

**Using MCP Tools:**

```json
// Discover available entity types
{
  "action": "list_types"
}

// Explore entity properties (Enhanced v2.0+)
{
  "action": "get_properties",
  "entityType": "UserStory"
}

// Get detailed property information (Enhanced v2.0+)
{
  "action": "get_property_details",
  "entityType": "UserStory",
  "propertyName": "CustomFields"
}

// Discover API structure through enhanced metadata
{
  "action": "discover_api_structure"
}
```

**Enhanced Implementation Steps** (v2.0+):
1. Use `inspect_object` with `list_types` to discover all entity types (now 5-10x faster)
2. For each entity type, use `get_properties` to get structured basic information
3. For detailed property discovery, use `search_entities` with `take=1` and `include=[CustomFields]`
4. Create a relationship map using `registry_info.commonIncludes` as guidance
5. Document the discovered data model for future reference

**Enhanced Performance Considerations** (v2.0+):
- Metadata discovery is now significantly faster with hybrid approach
- Results include structured information about entity capabilities
- Graceful handling of endpoint failures with fallback mechanisms
- Pagination support for large instances with many custom entity types
- Enhanced error messages with actionable suggestions

## Enterprise Analytics and Reporting

**Business Value:**
- Create custom reports not available in the standard UI
- Perform trend analysis across projects and teams
- Generate executive dashboards with real-time data
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

**Using MCP Tools:**

```json
// Get all projects with budget information
{
  "type": "Project",
  "include": ["Budget", "Teams", "UserStories"],
  "take": 1000
}

// Get all completed stories in a date range
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "where": "EntityState.Name eq 'Done' and ModifyDate gt '2024-01-01' and ModifyDate lt '2024-12-31'",
  "include": ["Project", "Team", "TimeSpent", "Effort"],
  "take": 1000
}

// Get team velocity data
{
  "type": "TeamIteration",
  "include": ["Team", "UserStories", "Features"],
  "where": "EndDate lt @Today",
  "orderBy": ["EndDate desc"],
  "take": 100
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Identify the metrics and KPIs needed for analysis
2. Design queries to extract the relevant data
3. Implement data transformation and aggregation logic
4. Create visualization or export mechanisms
5. Schedule regular data extraction for trend analysis

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use specific queries to limit result sets
- Implement incremental data extraction for historical analysis
- Consider data warehousing for long-term storage and analysis
- Use pagination for large result sets

## Cross-System Integration

**Business Value:**
- Create a unified view across multiple systems
- Automate cross-system workflows
- Eliminate manual data entry and synchronization
- Enable end-to-end process visibility

**Using MCP Tools:**

```json
// Create a new user story from external system data
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "name": "Integrate payment gateway",
  "description": "Imported from JIRA: PROJ-123",
  "project": {
    "id": 456
  },
  "team": {
    "id": 789
  }
}

// Update status based on external system events
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "id": 12345,
  "fields": {
    "status": {
      "id": 67
    },
    "description": "Updated via integration: Build passed in Jenkins"
  }
}

// Search for items with external system references
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "where": "Description contains 'JIRA:'",
  "include": ["Project", "Team", "AssignedUser"]
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Map entity types and fields between systems
2. Implement bidirectional synchronization logic
3. Create webhooks or scheduled jobs for updates
4. Implement conflict resolution strategies
5. Add audit logging for integration activities

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implement rate limiting to avoid API throttling
- Use batch operations for bulk updates
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider eventual consistency for non-critical updates

## Batch Operations and Mass Updates

**Business Value:**
- Implement organizational changes quickly
- Apply consistent updates across projects
- Reduce manual effort for administrative tasks
- Support reorganization or restructuring initiatives

**Using MCP Tools:**

```json
// Find all unassigned high-priority items
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "where": "AssignedUser is null and Priority.Name eq 'High'",
  "take": 1000
}

// Reassign items to a new team (execute for each item)
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "id": 12345,
  "fields": {
    "team": {
      "id": 789
    }
  }
}

// Update status for multiple items (execute for each item)
{
  "type": "Bug",
  "id": 67890,
  "fields": {
    "status": {
      "id": 42
    }
  }
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Identify the entities that need to be updated
2. Create a backup or snapshot before making changes
3. Implement the updates in batches with error handling
4. Verify the changes and provide a summary report
5. Document the changes for audit purposes

**Performance Considerations:**
- Process updates in small batches (50-100 items)
- Implement concurrency control to avoid conflicts
- Add delays between batches to reduce API load
- Provide progress reporting for long-running operations

## Custom Field Analysis and Management

**Business Value:**
- Ensure consistent use of custom fields
- Identify unused or redundant fields
- Support data governance initiatives
- Improve reporting accuracy

**Using MCP Tools:**

```json
// Get custom field definitions
{

  "entityType": "CustomField"
}

// Find entities using specific custom fields
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "where": "CustomField.RiskLevel is not null",
  "take": 500
}

// Analyze custom field usage
{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "include": ["CustomFields"],
  "take": 1000
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Extract all custom field definitions
2. Analyze usage patterns across entities
3. Identify inconsistencies or gaps
4. Create recommendations for optimization
5. Implement changes to improve data quality

**Performance Considerations:**
- Sample data for initial analysis rather than processing all records
- Focus on high-value custom fields first
- Consider the impact of custom field queries on API performance
- Implement progressive analysis for large datasets

## Process Compliance and Governance

**Business Value:**

{
  "type": "UserStory",
  "where": "Description is null or Description eq ''",
  "include": ["Project", "Team", "AssignedUser"],
  "take": 500
}

// Check for items stuck in process
{
  "type": "Bug",
  "where": "EntityState.Name eq 'In Progress' and ModifyDate lt '2024-01-01'",
  "include": ["AssignedUser", "Team"],
  "take": 500
}

// Verify proper relationships
{
  "type": "Task",
  "where": "UserStory is null",
  "include": ["Project", "Team"],
  "take": 500
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Define compliance rules and governance requirements
