## üéØ Semantic Operations Context

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This project implements semantic operations, not simple API wrappers!**

Before suggesting a feature, please consider:
- Does this feature provide intelligent workflow assistance?
- Would it help users complete tasks more naturally?
- Does it understand and adapt to user context?
- Would it guide users when things go wrong?

If you're requesting "add endpoint X from the API", please reconsider. We build intelligent operations, not API mirrors.

## Feature Description

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**How would this work as a semantic operation?**
- What workflow does this support?
- How would it adapt to different user roles?
- What intelligent assistance would it provide?
- How would it handle errors gracefully?

## Example Usage

**Describe how a user would interact with this feature:**
```typescript
// Example of how the semantic operation would work
await mcp.execute("your-operation", {
  // parameters
});

// Expected intelligent response
{
  result: "...",
  suggestions: ["next logical step", "alternative approach"],
  context: "why this makes sense in the workflow"
}
```

**Remember:** We're building tools that understand how people work, not just what APIs can do. Your feature should make someone's workday easier and more intelligent.
