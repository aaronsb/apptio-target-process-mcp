## Modular Architecture Refactoring (2024-02-24)

### Context
The original implementation had all functionality in a single `index.ts` file, which would have become difficult to maintain as we add more features and complexity. We needed to ensure the codebase could grow in a maintainable way.

### Changes Made

1. **Entity Layer Implementation**
   - Created base entity types that mirror TargetProcess's entity hierarchy
   - Implemented proper inheritance chain (GeneralEntity → AssignableEntity → specific entities)
   - Added type-safe interfaces for entity data

2. **API Layer Restructuring**
   - Created dedicated service layer for API interactions
   - Implemented proper request/response types
   - Added error handling and type safety
   - Separated API concerns from business logic

3. **Tool Layer Modularization**
   - Split tools into separate modules (search, get, create, update)
   - Added input validation using Zod schemas
   - Improved error handling and type safety
   - Made tools more maintainable and testable

### Technical Decisions

1. **File Structure**
   - Organized by domain concepts rather than technical types
   - Each module has its own directory with related files
   - Clear separation between entities, API, and tools

2. **Type Safety**
   - Used TypeScript interfaces to model API data structures
   - Added Zod schemas for runtime validation
   - Proper error handling with specific error types

3. **Module Resolution**
   - Using Node16 module resolution
   - Explicit file extensions for imports
   - Proper path aliases and relative imports

### Future Considerations

1. **Testing**
   - Each module is now easily testable in isolation
   - Can add unit tests for entities, services, and tools
   - Can mock API responses for testing tools

2. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add new entity types
   - Can extend API functionality without touching existing code
   - Tool implementations can be modified independently

3. **Documentation**
   - Architecture is documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Each module has its own documentation
   - Clear patterns for adding new features

### Commit Message

```
refactor: implement modular architecture

- Split monolithic index.ts into modular components
- Create proper entity hierarchy matching TargetProcess API
- Add type-safe API layer with proper error handling
- Implement modular tool system with validation
- Add architecture and development documentation

This refactoring improves maintainability, testability, and
extensibility of the codebase by properly separating concerns
and implementing clear patterns for future development.
